Description: GSAdapt is a method designed to derive a biologically specific set of genes relevant to transcriptomic expression. It requires both transcriptomic data and a collection of gene sets. GSAdapt filters out spurious correlated genes from each gene set according to user-defined specifications. The resulting outcome can be utilized for various exploratory analyses, including heatmaps, survival analyses, or hierarchical clustering.
