Description: GSAdapt is a method designed to derive a biologically meaningful signature from a highly dispersed, publicly available gene set. It requires both a transcriptomic dataset and a collection of gene sets. Using graph methods, GSAdapt will filter out spurious coexpressed genes from each gene set according to user-defined specifications. The resulting adapted gene set can be utilized in various exploratory analyses, including heatmaps, survival analyses, or hierarchical clustering for interrogating that biological context.
