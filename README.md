## Scripts

These repository contains a set of scripts for adapting published/ curated gene sets to a specific transcriptomic cohort. The main objective is to obtain the best training cutoff that discriminates worse-prognostic-patients from best-prognostic-patients. In this work, we do not analyse deeply Node Centrality adaptation but we provide some commands that could be useful if a more comprehensive analysis of graphs were required. On the other hand, we upload remarkable examples to the user in order to facilitate their comprehension of this bioinformatic pipeline.
