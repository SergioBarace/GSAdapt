GSAdapt is an easy-to-use tool designed to adapt public gene set collections. With the help of an association filter it would be possible to generate spatial graphs in which central properties are assessed to ensure gene set adaptation. The resulting adapted gene sets from graph models represent a core that explains gene to gene co-expression and gives biological information associated to each individual transcritome.

## Installation

You can install the development version of GSAdapt like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("SergioBarace/GSAdapt")
```
